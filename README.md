# Unity Tetris Inventory C#
C# Unity Projects 2019/2020

# Description
This project is composed of C# files, that were programmed in visual studio linked to Unity 2019.2.4f1 (64bits).

The main ideia of this project is to implement a Tetris Inventory in Unity. The tetris inventory is the same used in Resident Evil 4 and Diablo. Unfortunately I did not find any good stuff in the internet, so I developed it by my own (which means that it could be optimized yet).

I used this files to use the Tetris Inventory in a 2D roguelike game.
